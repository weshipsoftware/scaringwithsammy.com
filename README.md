# Scaring with Sammy

Scaring with Sammy is a channel dedicated to scareactors and the art of scareacting. Less fluff; more content.
These are quick 3 - 10 minute (mostly under five) videos of scareactor tips and techniques for scareactors of all levels and experience.

## Running Locally

Use [alternator](http://jarrodtaylor.github.io/alternator/) to generate a static site from `src` into `docs`.

```shell
scaringwithsammy.com % alternator src docs -p 80
```

## Deploys

Push changes on the `main` branch and GitHub Pages will pick them up.
